# loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)

Loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is one of the most popular isothermal DNA
amplification techniques for research and commercial applications, enabling amplification of
both DNA and RNA (with the assistance of reverse transcriptase). The LAMP mechanism is
powered by strategic primer design and a strand displacement polymerase, generating products
that fold over, creating loops. LAMP leads to generation of products of increasing length over
time. These products containing multiple loops are conventionally called cauliflower
structures. Existing literature on LAMP provides extremely limited understanding of
progression of cascades of reactions involved in the reaction and it is believed that cauliflower
structures of increasing length constitute a majority of the product formed in LAMP. This study
presents a first of its kind stoichiometric and pseudo kinetic model to comprehend LAMP
reactions in deeper depth by (i) classifying LAMP reaction products into uniquely identifiable
categories, (ii) generating a condensed reaction network to depict millions of interconnected
reactions occurring during LAMP, and (iii) elucidating the pathways for amplicon generation.
Despite the inherent limitations of conventional stoichiometric modelling for polymerization
type reactions (the network rapidly becomes too large and intractable), our model provides new
theoretical understanding of the LAMP reaction pathway. The model shows that while longer
length products are formed, it is the smaller length recycle amplicons that contribute more
towards the exponential increase in the amount of double stranded DNA. Prediction of
concentration of different types of LAMP amplicons will also contribute substantially towards
informing design of probe-based assays.
